## Summary

This is the SERVER modification of [SPT-Aki](https://www.sp-tarkov.com/) to allow the [Coop Module](https://github.com/stayintarkov/StayInTarkov.Client) to communicate with the SPT-Aki Server.

## How to use this Repo?

* Install SIT via the Launcher (or manually)
* Download and Install the latest SPT-Aki Server

## How do I set up this mod?

### Coop Config JSON
* You must configure the file called coopConfig.json in your SITCoop/config folder. This file is auto generated on first run of the mod.

#### IF you are using PORT FORWARDING
* In the file you must use the following config, replacing `127.0.0.1` with your own IPv4 from https://www.whatismyip.com and set useExternalIPFinder to false 
* OR set useExternalIPFinder to true

#### IF you are using HAMACHI or other VPN service
* set useExternalIPFinder to false
* set externalIP to your desired IP from the service

### Http.json

* Open Aki_Data\Server\configs\http.json with your favourite text editor
* Change the `ip` setting to your internal network IP of your Computer Primary Network (Ethernet or Wi-Fi)
* Change the `logRequests` setting to `false` to prevent log spam
